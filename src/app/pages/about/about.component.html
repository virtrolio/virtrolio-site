        We’re a group of undergraduate university students who remember exactly what it was like back in high school
        (at The Woodlands Secondary School, to be exact, woot woot),
        and we especially remember what those last few months of senior year meant to many of us. With the COVID-19
        pandemic leading to lockdowns and social distancing, we wanted to create an alternative way for graduating
        students (and
        others!) to be able to send each other messages in a medium that they can cherish with them as they continue on
        in their journeys.
