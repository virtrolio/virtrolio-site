# Virtrolio

Virtrolio was founded due to the COVID-19 pandemic closing schools and preventing students from signing each other's
yearbooks. Virtrolio is a web service that lets you privately send messages to a friend or colleague and allows only
them to view the messages that are destined for them. With the help of some HTML, CSS, TypeScript, love, sweat, and
tears, we've combined the fun, privacy, and intimacy of yearbook signing with digital features such as fonts, colors,
emojis and more!

## How We Built It

Virtrolio is built using Angular and Bootstrap in the front end, with Firebase for data storage, hosting, and user
authentication. Firebase was chosen for its ease of use and integration of various secure login authentication
providers. If you would like to help us further improve Virtrolio, feel free to fork our repository and create a pull
request.

## Our Goal

The goal of virtrolio is to allow users to write memorable messages to one another. We hope to give everyone the chance
to do this, even if they cannot physically be together.
