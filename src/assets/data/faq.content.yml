  questions:
    - question: How do I sign someone's virtrolio?
      answer: >
        Ask them for their 'sharing link' (which they can get from their 'My
        virtrolio' page). Then visit that sharing link and sign in if you
        haven't already. You will then be taken to a wonderful place with many
        formatting tools to type your customized message.
    - question: How do I delete a message I sent?
      answer: >
        As per our <a href="/privacy-policy">privacy policy</a>, you cannot
        delete a message once you have sent it. This is to more closely emulate
        real-life yearbook signing, in that the virtrolio (and all its messages)
        will stay with the <em>receiver</em>. In order to have your message
        deleted, you must ask the <em>recipient</em> of your message to delete
        it.
    - question: Can I sign someone's virtrolio more than once?
      answer: >
        Yes and no. For any one version of the website (for example, if you just
        created an account with us), then you will only be able to send one
        message to each of your friends per calendar year. You probably wouldn't
        sign someone's yearbook more than once in real life (unless you just
        <em>wanted</em> to take space away from others). As such, we decided
        that you can send one very special, meaningful message. However, if we
        make a major update to the website, then we will allow for <strong>one
        extra message to be sent to each of your friends</strong> so that you
        can try out the new update's features. If we do make a major update to
        the website, you'll find a note telling you that you can send an extra
        message for the year in the changelog, which you can find by clicking
        "What's New?" at the top of the page.
    - question:
        Can I add images, drawings, doodles, or scribbles to my messages?
      answer: >
        <p>Yes, if you have the images uploaded to some other website (since we
        do not store images on Virtrolio). We're working on adding a menu to
        allow you to do this soon!</p>  <p>However, if you know a bit of HTML,
        you can do it yourself like this: <strong   style="font-family:
        Consolas, sans-serif">&lt;img src="insert link URL"&gt;</strong> You
        will be able to   see the image in the preview panel while you sign your
        message if you do it properly with a URL that
        works.</p>  <p><strong>Note: Not every URL works, and some URLs will
        only work temporarily, which makes things difficult   when you want the
        messages to last for a long time. We are not responsible if your link
        breaks and the   picture no longer shows up on a message you have
        sent.</strong> If the URL holding your image stops working,   then so
        will your image, even if you already sent it. The only way a recipient
        could keep the image if it   was on a temporary link is if they printed
        out their virtrolio or downloaded a type of file that would allow   them
        to view the image (features which we have not implemented yet). As such,
        we recommend that you link to   images which you know will work not only
        now but also in the future when your friend reads your message.   Google
        Photos links will not work unless they are on a shared album (this has
        not been tested thoroughly).   Other image sharing / storing   services
        such as Google Drive and Imgur are possible alternatives. Virtrolio is
        not making any suggestions   for software to use in this regard; we are
        simply making you aware of the options that are out there.</p>  <p>Even
        if the URL you use does lead to an image, the URL must contain ONLY an
        image for it to work in   your virtrolio message. For example, <a
        target="_blank" href="https://bit.ly/2NRCMvu">this link</a> will
        not   work but <a target="_blank" href="https://bit.ly/2BuNxkA">this
        one</a> will. Usually, a 'usable' URL in this   context will have an
        'image file extension' at the end of the URL—something like .jpg or .png
        or .gif. Some   people call this type of link an 'embed link', as these
        links can be used to 'embed' content into a website.   To find this
        link, you could search up how to get the 'embed link' for whatever
        online service you used to   upload and store your photos. For some
        websites, it is much easier to get this embed link—the website
        might   even provide an easy-to-use button. For other websites, you
        might need to right-click on an image and try to   click 'Open image in
        new tab' until you get a link which looks like a valid 'embed link' with
        only the image   on it. </p>  <p>On a related note, if you know some
        more HTML / CSS then you can (to a limited extent) style your
        images   too (for example, <strong style="font-family: Consolas,
        sans-serif">&lt;img src="URL" width = 100%&gt;</strong> is very
        useful   for scaling your images to a proper, viewable size). We are
        working on a more user-friendly menu to be able to insert images into
        your message if you're not comfortable with this, so watch out for
        that!</p>
    - question:
        Can I download my messages in some way? Maybe saving as a word document
        or a PDF?
      answer: >
        After sending your messages, you do not own them anymore, so you cannot
        download or save them. If you want to download and save the messages you
        have <em>received</em>, we currently have the option for you to download
        all your data as a .json file (go to your settings page for this
        option). We are working on a way for you to be able download your
        messages in a more user-friendly format, though, so stay tuned!
    - question: How do I get a new sharing link?
      answer: >
        Go to <a href="/my-virtrolio">your virtrolio</a> and click on 'Sharing
        Link', then generate a new link from there. Be aware—doing so will
        invalidate all previous links!
    - question: Why would I want a new sharing link?
      answer: >
        You can generate a new sharing link if people are sending you messages
        you do not approve of using your old one. This helps prevent spammers
        and bullies from clogging up your virtrolio. Only people with your
        <em>newest</em> sharing link can sign your virtrolio.
- sectionTitle: Miscellaneous
  questions:
    - question: What do I do if I get messages I don't approve of?
      answer: >
        Delete the messages from your virtrolio; as the recipient, according to
        our <a href="/privacy-policy">privacy policy</a>, you are the only one
        with the authority to do this. You can also generate a new sharing link
        to prevent people from using your old sharing links. If the problem
        persists, you can <a href="mailto:virtrolio.team@gmail.com"
        target="_blank">send us an email</a> and we can take more authoritative
        action.
    - question: Can I sign in with anything other than Google?
      answer: >
        Currently, no. Sorry! There are plans to add more sign-in options in the
        future though, so stay tuned!
    - question: Can I get a custom key for my sharing link?
      answer: >
        We may add this feature in the future, but for now it's only for the
        developers. Sorry!
    - question: Can I change my display name?
      answer: >
        No, your display name is taken directly from your Google Account.
        Because of this, we suggest you use a personal Gmail account to sign up
        for Virtrolio.
