  <h3>SUMMARY</h3>
  <p>In short, you agree to abide by our code of conduct for safe, respectful, and common-sense behaviour. You
    understand that we will do everything in our power to address reported violations of the code or these Terms,
    including account termination at our discretion, but that the ultimate responsibility for a message's contents,
    including links to third-party sites, lies with the user who sent it. You agree not to reproduce or alter
    any of our intellectual property for unlicensed use, and where necessary, you agree to obtain parental
    consent to use our site.
    This summary is for convenience only; please read the terms below carefully.</p>
  <h3>OVERVIEW</h3>
  <p>This website is operated by Virtrolio. Throughout the site, the terms “we”, “us” and “our” refer to Virtrolio.
    Virtrolio offers this website, including all information, tools and services available from this site to you,
    the user, conditioned upon your acceptance of all terms, conditions, policies and notices stated here.</p>
  <p>By visiting our site, you engage in our “Service” and agree to be bound by the following terms and conditions
    (“Terms of Service”, “Terms”), including those additional terms and conditions and policies referenced herein and/or
    available by hyperlink. These Terms of Service apply to all users of the site, including without limitation users
    who are browsers and/or contributors of content.</p>
  <p>Please read these Terms of Service carefully before accessing or using our website. By accessing or using any part
    of the site, you agree to be bound by these Terms of Service and any other policies listed here. If you do not agree
    to all the terms and conditions of this agreement, then you may not access the website or use any services. If these
    Terms of Service are considered an offer, acceptance is expressly limited to these Terms of Service.</p>
  <p>Virtrolio is a message sharing and viewing service that allows users to recreate in-person yearbook signings.
    In order to digitally emulate the essence of this act, certain data policies and terms have been enacted
    accordingly.</p>
  <p>Any new features or tools which are added to the current website shall also be subject to the Terms of Service.
    You can review the most current version of the Terms of Service at any time on this page. We reserve the right to
    update, change, or replace any part of these Terms of Service by posting updates and/or changes to our website. It
    is your responsibility to check this page periodically for changes. Your continued use of or access to the website
    following the posting of any changes constitutes acceptance of those changes.</p>
  <h3>SECTION 1 - GENERAL CONDITIONS</h3>
  <p>We reserve the right to refuse service to anyone for any reason at any time.</p>
  <p>You understand that your content (not including credit card information), may be transferred unencrypted and
    involve (a) transmissions over various networks; and (b) changes to conform and adapt to technical requirements of
    connecting networks or devices. Credit card information is always encrypted during transfer over networks.</p>
  <p>You agree not to reproduce, duplicate, copy, sell, resell or exploit any portion of the Service, use of the
    Service, or access to the Service or any contact on the website through which the service is provided, without
    express written permission by us.</p>
  <p>The headings used in this agreement are included for convenience only and will not limit or otherwise affect these
    Terms.</p>
  <h3>SECTION 2 - TERMINATION OF SERVICE</h3>
  <p>A breach or violation of the conditions listed in these Terms or other relevant policies will result in a
    termination of your Services, including but not limited to: deletion of your account and all associated data
    (see more on our data policies in our Privacy Policy) and banning of your email address to prevent further account
    access or creation therein. </p>
  <p>We may, at our own discretion, give you advance notice of account termination. Your account will not be
    reconsidered for reacceptance into our Service, except under specific circumstances to be established through
    individual written communication and at our sole discretion.</p>
  <p>The obligations and liabilities of the parties incurred prior to the termination date shall survive the termination
    of this agreement for all purposes.</p>
  <p>These Terms of Service are effective unless and until terminated by either you or us. You may terminate these
    Terms of Service at any time by notifying us that you no longer wish to use our Services, or when you cease using
    our site.</p>
  <p>If in our sole judgment you fail, or we suspect that you have failed, to comply with any term or provision of these
    Terms of Service, we also may terminate this agreement at any time without notice and accordingly may deny you
    access to our Services (or any part thereof).</p>
  <h3>SECTION 3 - MODIFICATIONS TO THE SERVICE</h3>
  <p>We reserve the right at any time to modify or discontinue the Service (or any part or content thereof) without
    notice at any time.</p>
  <p>Occasionally there may be information on our site or in the Service that contains typographical errors,
    inaccuracies or omissions. We reserve the right to correct any errors, inaccuracies or omissions, and to change or
    update information if any information in the Service is inaccurate at any time without prior notice.</p>
  <p>We undertake no obligation to update, amend, or clarify information in the Service except as required by law.
    No specified update or refresh date applied in the Service should be taken to indicate that all information in the
    Service or on any related website has been modified or updated.</p>
  <p>You agree that from time to time we may remove the service for indefinite periods of time or cancel the service at
    any time. In such a case, you will receive notification by email. If service termination is deemed permanent or
    exceptional by circumstance, appropriate measures will be put in place for you, the user, to be able to retrieve
    your data, though we make no promise as to the amount of time which this may take.</p>
  <h3>SECTION 4 - THIRD-PARTY LINKS AND SERVICES</h3>
  <p>The developers of Virtrolio have made use of third-party softwares and services in order to be able to provide our
    service to you. As such, by using our service you also agree to any relevant terms, policies, and practices which
    extend from those third-party services, including, but not limited to, those associated with
    <a href="https://firebase.google.com/terms/" target="_blank">Google Firebase</a> and its collection of anonymous
    data; and with third-party sign-in providers such as Google and their authentication services. We will enforce
    these Terms in accordance with any relevant third-party policies.</p>
  <p>Furthermore, certain content available on our Service may include third-party material. Third-party links on this
    site may direct you to third-party websites that are not affiliated with us. We are not responsible for examining or
    evaluating the content or accuracy and we do not warrant and will not have any liability or responsibility for any
    third-party materials or websites, or for any other views, endorsements, materials, products, or services of
    third-parties.</p>
  <p>While we support the embedding of images via third-party links within messages, we currently cannot guarantee that
    such images will display as intended, nor that the image will not be removed or otherwise made unavailable by the
    hosting provider. Responsibility for selecting a third-party service and ensuring that an image displays as intended
    falls on the user; no recommendation or endorsement of any such service is made by Virtrolio. In addition, the user
    remains responsible for the contents of the image, and for obtaining the necessary rights or explicit permissions
    required to use the image.</p>
  <p>We are not liable for any harm or damages related to the purchase or use of goods, services, resources, content, or
    any other transactions made with any third-party websites. Please review carefully the third-party's policies and
    practices and make sure you understand them before you engage in any transaction. Complaints, claims, concerns, or
    questions regarding third-party products should be directed to the third-party.</p>

    which does not conform with these Terms or this Code of Conduct.</p>
  <p>You agree that your comments will not violate any right of any third-party, including copyright, trademark,
    privacy, personality or other personal or proprietary right. You further agree that your comments will not contain

    officers, directors, agents, contractors, licensors, service providers, subcontractors, suppliers, interns and
    employees, harmless from any claim or demand, including reasonable attorneys’ fees, made by any third-party due to

    violation of any law or the rights of a third-party.</p>
  <h3>SECTION 8 - DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTIES</h3>
  <p>You expressly agree that your use of, or inability to use, the service is at your sole risk. The service and all
    products and services delivered to you through the service are (except as expressly stated by us) provided 'as is'

    quality, fitness for a particular purpose, durability, title, and non-infringement.</p>
  <p>We do not guarantee, represent or warrant that your use of our service will be uninterrupted, timely, secure or

    incidental, punitive, special, or consequential damages of any kind, including, without limitation lost profits,
    lost revenue, lost savings, loss of data, replacement costs, or any similar damages, whether based in contract,

    incurred as a result of the use of the Service or any content (or product) posted, transmitted, or otherwise made
    available via the Service or via the conduct or interactions of other users thereof, even if advised of their

    consequential or incidental damages, in such states or jurisdictions, our liability shall be limited to the maximum
    extent permitted by law.</p>
  <h3>SECTION 9 - INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY</h3>
  <p>Notwithstanding the public availability of the source code associated with the operation of the Service, we assign

    notices.</p>
  <h3>SECTION 10 - SEVERABILITY</h3>
  <p>In the event that any provision of these Terms of Service is determined to be unlawful, void or unenforceable, such
    provision shall nonetheless be enforceable to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, and the unenforceable
    portion shall be deemed to be severed from these Terms of Service, such determination shall not affect the validity
    and enforceability of any other remaining provisions.</p>
  <h3>SECTION 11 - ENTIRE AGREEMENT</h3>
  <p>The failure of us to immediately exercise or enforce any right or provision of these Terms of Service shall not
    constitute a waiver of such right or provision (i.e. for the future).</p>
  <p>These Terms of Service and any policies or operating rules posted by us on this site or in respect to The Service
    constitutes the entire agreement and understanding between you and us and govern your use of the Service,
    superseding any prior or contemporaneous agreements, communications and proposals, whether oral or written, between
    you and us (including, but not limited to, any prior versions of the Terms of Service).</p>
  <p>Any ambiguities in the interpretation of these Terms of Service shall not be construed against the drafting
    party.</p>
  <p>The obligations and liabilities of the parties incurred prior to the termination date shall survive the termination
    of this agreement for all purposes.</p>
  <p>These Terms of Service are effective unless and until terminated by either you or us. You may terminate these
    Terms of Service at any time by notifying us that you no longer wish to use our Service, or when you cease using our
    Service by deleting your account.</p>
