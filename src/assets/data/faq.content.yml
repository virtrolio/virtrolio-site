    - question: How do I sign someone's virtrolio?
      answer: >
        Ask them for their 'sharing link' (which they can get from their 'My
        virtrolio' page). Then visit that sharing link and sign in if you
        haven't already. You will then be taken to a wonderful place with many
        formatting tools to type your customized message.
    - question: How do I delete a message I sent?
      answer: >
        As per our <a target="_blank" href="/privacy-policy">privacy policy</a>,
        you cannot delete a message once you have sent it. This is to more
        closely emulate real-life yearbook signing, in that the virtrolio (and
        all its messages) will stay with the <em>receiver</em>. In order to have
        your message deleted, you must ask the <em>recipient</em> of your
        message to delete it.
    - question: Can I sign someone's virtrolio more than once?
      answer: >
        Yes and no. For any one version of the website (for example, if you just
        created an account with us), then you will only be able to send one
        message to each of your friends per calendar year. You probably wouldn't
        sign someone's yearbook more than once in real life (unless you just
        <em>wanted</em> to take space away from others). As such, we decided
        that you can send one very special, meaningful message. However, if we
        make a major update to the website, then we will allow for <strong>one
        extra message to be sent to each of your friends</strong> so that you
        can try out the new update's features. If we do make a major update to
        the website, you'll find a note telling you that you can send an extra
        message for the year in the changelog, which you can find by clicking
        "What's New?" at the top of the page.
    - question: >
        **NEW** Can I add images, drawings, doodles, or scribbles to my
        messages?
      answer: >
        Yes! We introduced the ability to attach your own images to messages by
        uploading them to our site in version 2.0.0. When signing someone's
        virtrolio, click the Image button in the toolbar to try it out! The
        possibilities are endless - send a picture of a handwritten message, add
        in your favorite photo with your friend, send a meme, whatever you want!
    - question: Can I download my messages?
      answer: >
        After sending your messages, you do not own them anymore, so you cannot
        download or save them. If you want to download and save the messages you
        have <em>received</em>, we currently have the option for you to download
        all your data as a .json file (go to your <a target="_blank"
        href="/settings">settings</a> page for this option). We are working on a
        way for you to be able download your messages in a more user-friendly
        format, though, so stay tuned!
- sectionTitle: Your Sharing Link
  questions:
    - question: How do I get a new sharing link?
      answer: >
        Go to <a target="_blank" href="/my-virtrolio">your virtrolio</a> and
        click on 'Sharing Link', then generate a new link from there. Be
        awareâ€”doing so will invalidate your previous link!
    - question: Why would I want a new sharing link?
      answer: >
        You can generate a new sharing link if people are sending you messages
        you do not approve of using your old link. This helps prevent spammers
        and bullies from clogging up your virtrolio. Only people with your
        <em>newest</em> sharing link can sign your virtrolio.
- sectionTitle: Miscellaneous
  questions:
    - question: What do I do if I get messages I don't approve of?
      answer: >
        Delete the messages from your virtrolio; as the recipient, according to
        our <a target="_blank" href="/privacy-policy">privacy policy</a>, you
        are the only one with the authority to do this. You can also generate a
        new sharing link to prevent people from using your old sharing links. If
        the problem persists, you can <a target="_blank"
        href="mailto:virtrolio.team@gmail.com" target="_blank">send us an
        email</a> and we can take more authoritative action.
    - question: Can I sign in with anything other than Google?
      answer: >
        Currently, no. Sorry! There are plans to add more sign-in options in the
        future though, so stay tuned!
    - question: Can I change my display name?
      answer: >
        No, your display name is taken directly from your Google Account.
        Because of this, we suggest you use a personal Gmail account to sign up
        for Virtrolio.
